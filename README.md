# Craft-UML

Craft-UML is a desktop application built using Java and JavaFX for designing and editing UML diagrams. This project was developed as part of the Software Construction and Development course during my 5th semester of Bachelor's in Software Engineering.

  - Support for associations, generalizations, compositions, and other relationships
  - Edit and delete existing classes and relationships

- **Create UML Use Case Diagrams**
  - Add actors and use cases
  - Relationships like include, exclude, association, etc.
  - Modify or remove elements easily

- **Exporting and Saving**
  - Save diagrams as PNG or JPG for external use
  - Save diagrams in a custom file format for later editing within Craft-UML

- **Code Generation**
  - Generate boilerplate code from class diagrams

- **Error Handling**
  - Robust validation and user feedback for invalid operations
